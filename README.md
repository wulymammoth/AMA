# AMA (ask me anything)

From time to time, people are interested in asking me about my journey and just random other things and they either don't have a Twitter or can't find my email, etc

If you're interested in anything, just submit a pull-request with your question and I'll do my best to answer

Some things I've been asked about:
- how did you teach yourself?
- did you have a mentor?
- what are some of your favorite books both technical and non-technical?
- do you listen to podcasts? If so, which ones?
- what's your background?
- do you have a science degree?
